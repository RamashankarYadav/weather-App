# weather-App
This project fetches and displays real-time weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It dynamically updates the UI with the city name, country, current weather conditions, temperature (including min, max, and feels-like), humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The data is retrieved asynchronously to keep the interface responsive. Additionally, the project includes error handling to manage failed API requests, ensuring robustness. The weather information is automatically displayed when the page loads, providing a seamless user experience. The code is modular and maintainable, making it easy to update and customize.
